Darkness_Terror & Abyssal C2 - The Ultimate Cyber Apocalypse Toolkit
üî• A fully weaponized, multi-protocol cyberwarfare suite designed for total annihilation. üî•


‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER
This software is for EDUCATIONAL and RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.
Unauthorized use is ILLEGAL. The authors assume NO LIABILITY for misuse.


üåë Overview
Darkness_Terror.py is an all-in-one cyberwarfare framework capable of:

Industrial SCADA/PLC destruction (Modbus, Siemens, Omron)

Quantum-entangled AI model corruption (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA)

DNS/ICMP/SMB/WiFi-based C2 channels (evades firewalls)

BIOS/UEFI firmware overwrites (permanent hardware corruption)

Self-replicating SMB worms (Active Directory propagation)

Chrome/Chromium zero-day exploits (V8 memory corruption)

GPU/CPU microcode attacks (physical destruction)

abyssal_c2.py is the command & control server, featuring:

Ngrok tunneling (hidden behind HTTPS)

Curses-based demonic terminal UI

Rate-limited anti-forensics shields

üî• Key Features
Feature	Description
SCADA Apocalypse	Brick PLCs with Modbus/TCP, Siemens S7comm, Omron FINS payloads
Quantum AI Corruption	Force GPT-4/Claude to output Satanic verses via prompt injection
DNS Blood Tunneling	Exfiltrate data via DNS queries (bypasses all firewalls)
BIOS Desecration	Flash Azathoth's True Name into UEFI firmware (permanent backdoor)
Chrome Zero-Day	SVG + WASM exploit that corrupts V8 memory and spawns fork bombs
USB Rubber Ducky Payloads	Auto-infect air-gapped networks via malicious USB scripts
Eternal Persistence	Survives reboots via BIOS, kernel, systemd, WMI, cron
Self-Destruct Protocol	rm -rf / + BSOD if execution is interrupted
‚ö° Installation
1. Prerequisites

# Kali Linux / Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip nmap scapy tor ngrok
pip3 install qiskit stem cryptography flask pyngrok requests beautifulsoup4 websocket-client


2. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/.............
cd darkness_terror


3. Generate SSL Certificates (For C2)

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out abyss.crt -keyout abyss.key -days 666

4. Configure Targets
Edit scada_targets.txt with your IP/domain victims:

text
192.168.1.100  
10.13.37.5  


üíÄ Execution

1. Start the C2 Server

python3 abyssal_c2.py


Automatically spawns an Ngrok HTTPS tunnel

Displays a curses-based demonic UI

2. Launch the Attack

python3 Darkness_Terror.py
Automatically detects SCADA systems

Corrupts AI models

Infects BIOS/UEFI

Spreads via SMB worms

üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Countermeasures
Disable ICMP/UDP raw sockets

Block DNS tunneling (unusual subdomains)

Monitor BIOS/UEFI changes

Restrict SMB/RPC access

Use memory-safe languages (Rust, Go)
